# Routini
> Our team is developing a web application inspired by Habitica.com, focused on fostering positive routines and healthy habits. Users can create personalized avatars, manage their tasks (habits, dailies, todos) through creation, editing, and deletion. Additionally, a reward system allows users to earn and manage rewards, further enhancing their motivational journey. The application also features an inventory system for earned items, with the ability to equip and manage them. Bonus features include drag-and-drop functionality and a leveling system with a shop, encouraging user engagement and progress visualization.
